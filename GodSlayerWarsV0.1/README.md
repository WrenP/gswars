# barebones-express-ejs
A barebones node express ejs application featuring bootstrap.

## Requirements
To clone this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and to run this application you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer before you start. 

## To Use
First you need to either clone this git, or download as zip and extract the contents to a folder of your choosing. To clone the git via command window, use this command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dekita/barebones-express-ejs.git
```

After you have the respository on your computer (if you downloaded the zip, you need to extract it first) you should go into the folder and open a command window (press shift + right click in the folder). If you already have this opened (assuming you cloned the repo via command line in the step previous) you can use the following command to enter the folder:
```bash
cd barebones-express-ejs
```

Finally, you will need to install the dependancies. So enter the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

To run the application simply enter the command:
```bash
npm start
```
